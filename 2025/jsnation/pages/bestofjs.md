# Part 2: The Best of JS Story

## What is Best of JS?

A curated directory of the most popular and trending JavaScript projects. It's like a "GitHub stars tracker" that helps developers:

- Discover the most popular JavaScript tools and libraries
- Track project growth and trends over time
- Find new projects in specific categories (React, Vue, testing, etc.)

## Why Best of JS?

I love creating applications with erb technologies, it empowers me to write code that can run anywhere.

But it's challenging to keep up with its fast-paced ecosystem!

I wanted to create a tool to help developers like me find the "best of JS".

Goals:
- Gather open source web platform projects in one place
- Share clear insights about current trends
- Filter out deprecated and unmaintained projects
- Classify projects with meaningful tags

In 2015, I launched Best of JS using the awesome domain [js.org](https://js.org)

## How It Works

The main metric: GitHub stars! ⭐

It might sound simple, but the **evolution** of stargazers over time (not just raw numbers - this is key) is the best metric I've found to gauge a project's popularity (not its quality!)

Core concept:
- Maintain a curated list of projects, gathering insights from newsletters ([JavaScript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/)) and community suggestions
- Take a daily snapshot of each project's star count and store it in a database
- Rebuild the app daily, computing trends: daily, weekly, monthly...
