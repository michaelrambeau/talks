## Why Best of JS?

I love web technologies that run anywhere

But keeping up with the ecosystem is challenging!

Goals:
- Gather web platform projects
- Share trend insights
- Filter out deprecated projects
- Tag projects meaningfully

Launched in 2015 on [js.org](https://js.org)

## How It Works

Core metric: GitHub stars evolution ⭐

Not just raw numbers - the growth trend matters!

Process:
- Curate projects from newsletters and community
- Daily star count snapshots
- Compute trends (daily/weekly/monthly)
